Yelp Food Finder
Discription:
A applicaton to help search for places to eat using the Yelp Fuison API. User Inputs
a location (zipcode or city), a price range ($ => $$$$, $ being the least expensive),
and a food category (American, Chinese, etc.) and the application displays 12 
results that fits the parameters. 

Self Assessment:
I am very happy with the end result of this project. I really like the styling and 
how well the search component works. I was happy I tried to use a API because
I have learn a whole lot of how APIs work and how to impliment an API into an
Angular project. This project has also helped me tremendously with my fluidity
in Angular and web design overall (html, css, javascript). I can definetly see how
Angular makes developing a website easier, but I was not ready for the learning curve. 
In the future, I want to use Angular more in my side/passion projects. 

Note:
The double background image on the results component and the app component is 
intentional because I thought it was a cool visual effect
